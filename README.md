# Taking a look at the League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games ðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž

This is an independent final project I've performed for BDI 475 - Introduction to Data Analytics Applications in Business.

I picked the data set because I actually play league (although casually). I think being able to apply the knowledged I learned in the course and use it to analyze data related to a game I play is really neat and creates a connection between something I'm interested in and something I like to play.
